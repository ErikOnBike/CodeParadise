# Getting started
This document will describe how to get started on building your own webapplication. This description is for an [MVP](MVP.md)-based application, since this offers a rich environment to build your application in. For an explanation how an application 'works', please read the [implementation](Implementation.md) document first.

(this document is WIP)

For an explanation about applications see [Applications](Applications.md).

For an explanation about MVP see [MVP](MVP.md).
